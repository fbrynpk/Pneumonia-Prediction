# Pneumonia-Prediction

Trying to classify from X-Ray images whether it's classified as Pneumonia or Normal X-Ray Images by replicating the Tiny VGG Architecture

Architecture can be found from: "https://poloclub.github.io/cnn-explainer/"

> The trend shows that if the model train for longer then maybe it could still reduce the loss and increase the accuracy without overfitting
